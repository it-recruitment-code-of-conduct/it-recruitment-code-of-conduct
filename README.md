* ...pull requests here pls
* It's considered inappropriate to advertise or contact developers by
  commenting on their OpenSource projects or posting any irrelevant content that aims
  to spread recruiting activities on
  developers/programmers public repositories(like Github, Bitbucket), blogs and portfolios.

## Contributing

We hope all Software Developers, Programmers and IT personal would help
us to contribute to this Guide so we create generic manifesto for the
Recruiters to fallow and resource to point unprofessional Recruiters.

Recruiters may not be the most respectable people to deal with for us.
Some time it's because of their personality,
sometimes is because they don't understand what we are expecting from
them.  Maybe this will help a bit.
